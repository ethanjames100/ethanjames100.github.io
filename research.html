        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Sheffield, specializing in black holes, black hole perturbation theory, self-force theory, and modified gravity. I am particularyly interested in the self-force program and am applying self-force techniques to different scenarios with compact objects. I am also very interested in the Turnaround Radius as it can be a good tool for testing the \(\Lambda\)CDM Model.</p>

        <h2>Notable Publications</h2>
        <h3>"Adiabatic Inspirals under Electromagnetic Radiation Reaction on Kerr Spacetime" (2023, APS Physical Review D)</h3>
        <p>This paper examines how electromagnetic radiation reaction forces affect the inspiral of charged particles around Kerr black holes. It provides insights into the long-term orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational waveforms. The study enhances our understanding of the interplay between electromagnetic forces and gravitational interactions in strong-field regimes.</p>
        <h3>"Turnaround Radius for Charged Particles in the Reissner–Nordström deSitter Spacetime" (2024, General Relativity and Gravitation)</h3>
        <p>This research explores the dynamics of charged particles in the Reissner–Nordström deSitter spacetime, focusing on the turnaround radius. The turnaround radius is a critical parameter for understanding the motion of particles in spacetimes with both electric charge and a cosmological constant. The findings have implications for the study of charged black holes and their interactions with surrounding matter.</p>
        <h3>"Black Holes in Scalar-Tensor Gravity" (2022, University of Malta, BSc(Hons) Thesis)</h3>
        <p>This work investigates black holes within scalar-tensor theories of gravity, which extend general relativity by including additional scalar fields. The research aims to understand how these modifications affect black hole solutions and their observational properties. It provides a foundation for further studies on alternative theories of gravity and their astrophysical implications.</p>

        <h2>More Information</h2>
        <p>My research is driven by the goal of advancing our knowledge of black holes and their interactions with their environments. This is crucial for interpreting observational data from advanced astronomical instruments and for testing the predictions of general relativity and its alternatives.
