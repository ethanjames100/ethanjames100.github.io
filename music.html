    <h1>Music Projects</h1>
    I am currently involved in a few music projects:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Żibel</b> (Dec 2023-Present) - Thrash metal band based in Sheffield. I play lead guitar for this band and contriubute heavily to our style and direction. Check us out on instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zibel.official/">@zibel.official</a>. The name of the band is a long winded pun. The word <i>Żibel</i> is the Maltese word for garbage, which in american english is reffered to as <i>trash</i>, we play <i>thrash</i> metal which sounds rather similar. We will soon release our first single <i>Scattered Debris</i>.</li>
        <li><b>Born Live</b> (Oct 2024 - Present) - This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(metal_band)">Death</a> cover band in which I play bass guitar.</li>
    </ul>
    I have also been involved in a number of other music projects in the past:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Delirium</b> (Aug 2021 - Sep 2022) - Delirium are a gothic metal band based in Malta. They are still active (as of 2024). I was the only guitarist at the time, and during my time with the band we wrote and recorded a full length album called <i>State of Delirium</i>. Check them out on instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/delirium_malta/">@delirium_malta</a>. Unfortunately I had to leave this band in September 2022 since I was due to move to Sheffield to start my Ph.D. studies.</li>
        <li><b>Mythril</b> (Jan 2017 - Dec 2019) - A thrasm metal band from Malta, who are no longer active. I primarally played rhythm guitar with this band and contributed to writing orignal music. During this period we played a number of shows and recorded one single called <i>Crown of Fire</i>.</li>
        <li><b>Stride</b> (2017-2018) - A jazz band that played together and mostly jammed on standards. We once played a wedding, playing a number of jazz standards and pop tunes to get the party going!</li>
    </ul>
